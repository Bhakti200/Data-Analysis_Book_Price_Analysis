# Data-Analysis_Book_Price_Analysis

This dataset provides detailed information about the top-selling books across various genres, offering a deeper look into the book market. It includes important details like the book's name, author, user rating, number of reviews, price, year of publication, and genre. The book name helps identify each book, while the author field allows us to explore how different writers are performing in the market. User ratings give an idea of how well the book is received by readers, showing which books are favored. The number of reviews indicates how popular a book is among readers, with more reviews often meaning the book has a larger following. The price of the book shows how much it costs and can help identify trends in pricing strategiesâ€”whether books are generally expensive or affordable. The year of publication helps track changes in literary tastes over time, showing how certain books and genres become more popular or less over the years. Finally, the genre field groups the books into categories, helping us understand which genres are most popular and whether pricing or user ratings differ across these categories. Overall, this dataset helps us analyze how books are priced, received, and categorized, providing insights into consumer preferences and trends in the book industry.
